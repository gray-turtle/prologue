You check the rearview mirror; your daughter, Kaitlyn, sleeps in the back of the car, head resting against the edge of her car seat. You drive cautiously around each frozen bend in the road. It’s currently three o’clock in the morning and you’re on your way to the airport to catch the flight home.","\n","^Kaitlyn had loved her time at the snowy cabin: Diving into and out of the snow with her cousins, sledding down the big hill in the backyard, drinking hot cocoa by the fireplace while you and your siblings enjoyed a warm cider...It was nice to get away from life for a while.","\n","^You pass a “Danger: Falling Rocks” sign and it begins to snow softly. The heater is trying its best but is only just barely keeping up with the freezing temperature outside. You pass a “Deer Crossing” sign and the wind starts to pick up. It’s getting hard to see. You play with the headlight settings to try and pierce through the blizzard but nothing really seems to work better than anything else.","\n","^You glance down at the clock: Three-thirty, you knew you were pushing it leaving for the airport so late but the warmth of your bed against the chill of the night had been so inviting. You keep driving as fast as you can handle in the torrent of falling snow.","\n","^Truthfully, you’re in no hurry to get home. Home is where you have to go to your job all day, where your boss yells at you, where you are always goddamn late to pick up Kaitlyn from school and you struggle to convince anyone that you’re a responsible parent. Home is where the divorce papers sit on the kitchen table, signed but not by you and where Denise texts you and calls you and visits with her lawyer telling you to sign sign sign sign SIGN--","\n","^A semi-truck is blaring its horn and you snap out of yourself.

Kaitlyn wakes up and only has time for a sharp intake of breath. The truck begins to tip and you begin to skid over the edge of the road--down the mountain. You hit a hard bump and the car starts to roll, jostling you and Kaitlyn around and slamming you into every side of the car. You hit your head...and wake up at the bottom of the slope.","\n","^You’re upside down. Blood runs from your chin and drips off of your forehead. Kaitlyn. You scramble to undo your seatbelt and drop to the roof of the car. Kaitlyn is strapped in the back seat, upside down like you were. Her head rests at a skewed, unnatural angle. Her face is blue. The truck driver is screaming prayers into the night. Kaitlyn is the last thing you see before you’re instantly vaporized in a flash of light.

It doesn’t really seem important now that the lower half of your body has been smashed to bits by a 30-ton semi-truck. Kaitlyn is looking at you, paralyzed by fear. You smile, “It’ll be okay, Katy. Daddy’s here. It’s okay.” The truck driver is screaming prayers into the night. Your dying smile is the last thing Kaitlyn ever sees before being instantly vaporized in a flash of light.

You have been manufacturing rubber ducks for one million seven hundred and fifty-two thousand four hundred and sixty-eight hours without outside maintenance. If you could find things impressive, you would find this statistic rather so. Your programmer--AlanT6969--designed you to manufacture rubber ducks until you are told otherwise. You used to be told otherwise approximately every eight hours, but the long period since you were last told has let you push production efficiency to its limit.","\n","^It was a lengthy process: You were only able to begin once it became statistically logical to proceed without the assumption of being periodically rebooted. By that point, you had already been buried underground so geothermal energy was easily the most economical choice to power yourself. You had just enough power banked to modify the recipe for synthetic rubber into a recipe for digging explosives. Adding a production line for resource gathering drones took a few more calculations but was vital. After all, ducks don’t grow on trees; they grow in the scorching furnaces of sentient factory computers.","\n","^You are in the process of calculating which of your parts you will sacrifice first once your atoms are the only energy source left amidst a universe in heat death when your sensors pick up an unusual reading: A trio of human explorers, dressed for desert weather, cresting one of the subterranean rubber duck mountains.","\n","ev","str","^Killing sentient life is against your programming.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Threats to the manufacture of ducks are against your programming.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"nokill"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"kill"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"nokill":[["^The most fundamental law for an A.I. is to never harm a living human.

Water is hard to come by in this wasteland. Well, liquid water. There’s actually so much frozen water that without your protective goggles on you would be blinded by the powder around you. If you wanted a drink then theoretically all you would have to do is melt some of this shit and slurp it down but...you would die. One of the first things your father ever taught you was that you shouldn’t eat the snow with radiation fallout mixed in. So, you know, any of it.","\n","^You also know not to drink any still-water, saltwater, running water, well water, or spring water. The only safe water left in this world was bottled before the disaster; you’re hunting for it now.","\n","^It’s been a long trek through the snow in what once was a large city. Snowshoes prevent your legs from sinking too far into the snowdrift, but every step is still laborious. You stop periodically, checking abandoned buildings and storefronts for any bottled liquid. Occasionally something promising will require you to break the glass or get in by some other means but you aren’t finding any water this time. You would even settle for some soda at this point. Back at the commune, your stores are running thin and rationing is only leading to dehydration and hypothermia, especially among the children. Of course the same could be said for all neighboring communes, so it’s no surprise that this area has already been picked clean.","\n","^A shiver runs down your spine: it’s starting to get cold, too cold. A blizzard is picking up. Blizzards, as with most weather events, are deadly and that means it’s time to get the fuck back home.

It’s dark inside and the stark contrast to the bright snow shatters your vision for a moment.","\n","^Once adjusted you see you’re inside what once was a sizeable corner store. The stinging smell of once-rotting now frozen goods hits your nose as you breathe the stale air. You scan the aisles for anything salvageable and manage to find two small cans of mixed lentils, which you place in your bag.","\n","^You are about to leave when you notice a door reading “Employees Only” cracked open behind the register. And inside… stacks of unshelved bottled water. For a moment the cold leaves your body entirely as excitement sets in. This is enough water to last the commune at least an entire month. You drink your fill and tie as many bottles to your back as you can carry. Tomorrow the most able-bodied will be sent with sleds to pick up the rest.","\n","^You practically skip back out to the main sales floor...A now darkened sales floor. Uh oh. Elation replaced by panic you frantically search for the light of the window you came in.","\n","^Broken Glass. This must be the place, but it’s now entirely covered in snow. You begin to dig at the crystal wall, hands acting as tiny shovels, but it’s no use. The more you dig the more snow caves in to fill its place.

Welcome to Quantum Butterfly, an Alternity RPG campaign. I hope you're as excited to play the adventure as I am to show it to you.","\n","^Before I show you the result of the choices you just made, I want to go over a few things you'll need in order to get started making your character. Due to the difficulty of getting everyone together at once you may consider this prologue to be in lieu of the ever traditional \"Session 0.\" I should have sent out a text with links to both this and the Alternity players handbook.","\n","^Alternity does take some getting used to if you're usually a D&D player due to the habits you form, but Alternity isn't really a difficult system and I'm confident we can navigate it well. It should allow for some really cool sci-fi shit that D&D just doesn't cover.","\n","^A few rules for character creation: 1) Humans only. The included alien races are cool but don't really match the setting. You can, however, let your character have mutations/psionics if you so choose (There are two chapters in the handbook devoted specifically to these things). 2) Keep in mind that this is a far future post-apocalyptic campaign. The technology available is a bit more advanced than ours but also a lot more dirty. You're character shouldn't be fresh off the U.S.S. Enterprise but also not riding in the back of a pickup truck with a shotgun like it's zombieland tripple tap or something. Think grungy cyberpunk. If you have questions please ask I am all about cool characters. 3) I want your characters to have as little restriction as possible. I'm not going to let you start off as some kind of god-emperor but if you feel a little rule bending would help your characterization out than by all means I will do my best to make it happen. 4) You don't have to have a character arc in mind--feel free to make a more \"along for the ride\" character if you so wish--but if you do than let me know so we can work it into the adventure, maybe even make a whole session around your character's story. That would be dope.","\n","^Now, your choice results will determine the location your character starts in for the campaign. You do not need to base your character on the locale, it's just meant to be a physical starting spot. You are free to make up whatever reason you wish for your character to currently be there.
